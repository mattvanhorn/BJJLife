        <h4>Guidelines</h4>
        <p>Please keep to the topic, and please don't shill for companies or
        products that you are connected with. I will be adding a section for
        that type of post in the near future.</p>
        <p>Until then, anything that smells like blatant advertising will be removed.</p>
